                <p>The people of Capucas are just as passionate about their coffee, and took great pride in showing the people from Ground
                    around their site, and tasting the special varieties grown, such as bourbon and pacamara.</p>

                            <p>In Santa Rosa fewer than 75% of people are literate and poverty remains an issue in daily life.</p>
                            <p>In 2015 Ground raised Â£20,000 to provide an educational Hub including an IT centre and two teaching staff for
                            the Co-op members and their families to use. Inspired and in support of this The University of Honduras pledged a
                            huge $100,000 towards the project - taking it from what was planned to be a small community hub into an
                            institution transforming the local area.</p>
